title: The Nightshift - week 5

##Feedback

Hello, World!  We are now halfway through the Nightshift program - last night was the feedback night where we presented our ideas and prototypes to the clients and got some....FEEDBACK.  While this meetup wasn't structured with a formal talk, it was definitely structured with some food so lets DIVE IN.

###ay yo, wut u eat doe?

6:00 on the freakin dot I walk my ass into the Skookum offices and see the pizza just waiting...I don't want to be rude so I just grab a plate and make my way.  Now, there's a wide variety of pizzas on the table, and I'm not one to discriminate so I feel its my duty to at least try one of each.  So i get some pep, sausage and....r u ready....thin crust.  This might be controversial, and I'm sorry to my vegetarian peeps, but I'm gonna always go for that sausage pizza first...idk, i was just born this way ok.

Fast forward a few slices of pizza and WILD CHERRY PEPSI's later and its time to present.  We break up the Nightshift crew into different groups according to the clients they are working with.  There are two other groups working with the United Way so we stuck around in the main room to present.  I'm sure the crown-town compost crew and hand-up hooligans did a great job but unfortunately I didn't get to see their presentations so I cannot comment at this time.

###Povizio

The first group, Povizio, was tasked with the challenge of finding a way to create awareness of poverty and communicate information regarding issues such as this to the public.  In charlotte, there are tons of pockets and wedges of society that may not be aware how others live and the difficult financial decisions that many people make everytday just to get by.  This team created a very well designed and informative game that helps to give a real world perspective of what it can be like to raise a family and live life on a very small budget...a budget that demonstrates the tough financial choices one must make when the unexpected cureballs of life are thrown at your head.  The game will also help to demonstrate the humanitarian and accomodating aspects that the United Way provides which help to ease these burdens on many struggling citizens each day.

###Apollo

We presented next - our excellent project manager, jeremy, did a great job communicating our problem and solution to the representatives form UWCC.  Our Designer Andrew came through with some great mock-ups and prototypes to help convey the idea of our application.  In case you haven't been following (which idk why u wouldn't) we are helping to bridge the gap between people who want to volunteer and organizations that faciliate these volunteer opportunities.  Our application is going to bring the state of the UWCC volunteer opportunties from the trenches of .PDFs to the interactive world of volunteer organization profiles and dynamic volunteer opportunities.  Through our proposed solution we are logging organizations and their opportunities into a database that can be searched, categorized and followed.  In addition to that, we are helping potential volunteers find the perfect opportunity for their invdividual passions and skillsets through a short, captivating quiz.

###Hack Street Boyz

There was one other group solving the same problem we are, Team Hack Street Boyz.  We are paralleling each other in that we are both updating the current road map and means for volunteering.  Their prototypes looked really cool - I've noticed that all the groups working with UWCC are taking the mobile first approach and creating web apps rather than a native application.  With their application, a user can see more real time about opportunities that are happening around them and volunteer in a more instantaneous manner.  I really like their idea and I think that we can really jive off each other.  I think our idea will help the n00b volunteers really find what their passion is, and their idea will help get people active in opportunities that are happening in the area they are in.  I wish we could all work together collectively and put out one super sick app that encompasses all of these features.

After we all presented, we got some excellent feedback on what directions to take, what ideas to focus on, what works, what doesn't...in a nut shell, a real life experience with Agile and client facing interations.

The next step is to go over our feedback and get ready to start building this weekend at HACKATHON.  This should be pretty dope - we're going to code and code and code and hopefully have a good portion of our build done by Sunday. Our team is hoping to have our models, database and associations done by Friday so we can really focus on taking care of business with React this weekend.  Peace out.
