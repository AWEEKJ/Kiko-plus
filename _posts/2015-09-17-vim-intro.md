So yeah, I decided to start farting around with learning [VIM](http://www.vim.org/about.php)...what is VIM you may ask?  Well, while I was at [DBC](http://devbootcamp.com) I would describe it as that mysterious text editor/command line thing that all the instructors used - with VIM they worked super fast and looked super 1337.  Officially, VIM is described as the following:

> Vim seeks to provide the power of the de-facto Unix editor 'Vi', with a more complete feature set. Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.  Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE.

So it is a robust, highly configurable text editor that, when you know what you're doing, becomes a very powerful tool for efficiently writing code.  I always thought about playing with VIM but I just figured I would always feel "not ready" to go outside of sublime when I should be concentrating on some other cool facet of programming.  Well, that all changed when I watched the following video one day out of curiosity:

This video introduced me to the power of VIM and exposed some really great resources for learning VIM.  My favorite so far has been [VIM-Adventure](http://vim-adventure.com). I highly recommend checking out this interactive game that teaches you while you play...I'm addicted right now.  Anyways, just wanted to keep the blog chugging along and introduce you to some cool resources to help you learn VIM!  I'm not going to be doing work through VIM, but I plan on fudging around with it for a while each day.  Peace out.
