Ay yo, dis ya boi coming at you live from Starbuxxx just smoothing over some more concepts for my interview tomorrow.  With this whole week pretty much being consumed by algorithms and problem solving, I just wanted to go back to a place that makes a bit more sense - the front end.

A few weeks ago, I completed a [coding challenge]({% post_url 2015-08-18-coding-challenge-done %}) where I was given a screen shot of a website and presented with the task to recreate the web page from scratch.  The page includes a tab sidebar and login modal created from only Javascrpt and jQuery, with a table where the contents are populated by consuming an outside api.  Check out a screen shot of what I was given below and then [click here](http://john-lyden.com/coding-challenge-1/index.html) to see what I made in a day.
