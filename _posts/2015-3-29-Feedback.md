title: Feedback!
---

Welcome to my newest cultural blog post - this week, we are going to talk about peer pairing and giving/receiving feedback! Peer pairing is something completely new to me and frankly I was a bit apprehensive to try BUT I survived lol. Pairing has been helpful because it gives me a chance to review what I think I know and explain my methods to solve a problem. While it can be difficult and sometimes awkward, I definitely see the benefits of peer pairing.

Pairing hasn't really been what I would call "fun," but I have definitely had some "Aha" moments during pairing sessions, which is always good.  I do find it frustrating to be in a pairing session where we are both stuck and just seem to fumble around for the time alotted.  This early in the program, I have found that the best pairing sessions are always the guided pairing sessions because there is always someone to help out when we are stuck.  The whole point is for someone else to see what you're doing wrong/right but when you're both looking at the same new subject together it adds another level of stress to learning the material.  I personally learn better from traditional instruction that comes with examples so it's been a bit challenging to adapt to this new method of learning.

That said, it felt good to read good feedback and have some positive reinforcement on some of the concepts that we have been working on.
The feedback was helpful in that it let me know that I seem to be a decent pairing partner, although I dont know if I have taken away any other constructive criticism other than to communicate more clearly. Hopefully next time I can try to be more transparent in the way I describe my thought process.

Writing feedback has been alright. It's not always easy to leave feedback that is necessarily actionable because we are all learning at the same pace.  I think it would be beneficial to receive more feedback from the guides rather than other students. Although the criticism is definitely valued from everyone,  I am just in a mode of wanting to learn the material and keep my head above water during these first 9 weeks. I am more concerned with knowing if I am actually grasping these concepts rather than getting a good score on my pairings.
Overall, I see the benefits in pairing and feedback to guide my learning but it might be too soon to apply these methods at such an early stage. Pairing with a guide is far more beneficial to my learning style which is why I'm looking forward to the on-site phase of the program.
HAPPY PAIRINGS EVERYONE! PEACE OUT YALL
