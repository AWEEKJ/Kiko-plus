title: Chuck Norris Jokes!
---

It's [Monday Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eyN2I-TlyA) but it's not so bad.  This weekend was pretty great - Mi [BB](http://www.seaparties.blogspot.com) and I celebrated our two year anniversary with some good food from [Good Food on Montford](http://goodfoodonmontford.com/) and got some beauty new plants for our place.

Over the weekend I also wanted to work on a small project so I came up with this [Chuck Norris Joke app](norris).  I wanted to find an API to consume and build something simple but sort of funny.  I know these Norris jokes are pretty damn old, but whatevs it was fun to incorporate some AJAX and jQuery slide action on top of a Rails backend.  It's also good to get a little more experience with deploying...that asset pipeline can be a PITA sometimes, u feel me?
