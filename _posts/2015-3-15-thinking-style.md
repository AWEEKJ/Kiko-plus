title: Thinking Style!

###Time 2 Take a Technical Timeout!  This blog post is about thinking and learning.
Prior to completing all of the pre-requisites for attending DevBootcamp and learning my what my personal thinking style was, I had never really thought about how I was thinking.  Dev Bootcamp’s focus of realizing one’s own thinking style and applying that to learning material more efficiently is one of the main reasons I chose to attend Dev Bootcamp.

The first step to learning better is to figuring out how your mind works.  There is a short test you can take to figure out exactly how you think and how you learn best.  Once you know how your mind works, you become aware of what learning techniques work best for you.  Applying these techniques to the material you are covering is the best way to personalize the learning session to appeal to your specific way of thinking.

There are four different styles of thinking: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random…and what do they mean?  Well first, lets figure out what all these words mean.

Abstract is a perceptual quality that allows you to visualize, conceive ideas, and to understand or believe that which you can’t actually see.  Abstract involves using your intuition, imagination and looking beyond the surface to the more subtle implications - “It is not always what it seems.”

Concrete is a perceptual quality that enables you to register information directly through your five senses - you are dealing with the obvious, the “here and now.”  Concrete perception is not looking for hidden meanings - “It is what it is.”<br>

Sequential is an ordering ability that allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner.  Sequential follows a logical train of thought and prefers to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.

Random is an ordering ability that lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order.  Random allows you to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result - you can start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards.

So, now that I know what all of those words mean, I can understand why my personal learning style is Abstract Sequential.  An abstract sequential thinking style analyzes situations before making decisions or acting and applies logic in solving of finding solutions to problems.  I think this is an effective way of thinking in regards to computer programming, which is essentially applying logic to find solutions to problems through code.

I have been studying Ruby on my own for the past six months or so, and according to my thinking style, I learn best when I have access to experts or references and am placed in stimulating environments.  This is exactly why I wanted to attend a bootcamp style school for programming!  I can only get so far learning on my own - I know that I need to be immersed in the curriculum to feel like I have a true understanding of what I’m learning.

I also identify with the idea that it is hard for Abstract Sequential to learn a subject thoroughly with too little time - something that can be tough when moving at such a quick pace like we are in DBC.  I think that has been my biggest struggle so far, just feeling like I am thoroughly understanding each topic without spending double the amount of time on each exercise.  In order to combat these worries, I have been employing the Pomodoro Technique, where I set a timer for 25 minutes and focus on nothing but the material during that time, and then after 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break in which i try to enter a diffuse mode of thinking to allow my brain to broadly reflect on the information I just absorbed.  It’s been working so far - its just hard to get into that mode of staying focused, aka being “In the zone,” when theres non-stop noise and distractions going on outside.

Learning is all about having the right mindset.  A growth mindset is a desire to learn where you embrace challenges, persist in the face of setback, see effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others.  A fixed mindset is more of a desire to look smart where you tend to avoid challenges, give up early, see effort as fruitless, ignore useful feedback and feel threatened by the success of others.  A growth mindset is one where you continue to grow and thus is the type of mindset we should all strive to have.

Personally, I need to embrace challenges a bit more.  I do tend to get discouraged easily, so I am working on dealing with challenges in a structured way and making sure to take timeouts to clear my head…I can’t just bang my head against these books for hours and hope to absorb everything through osmosis.  Working out problems with my classmates and seeing how other people think through problems has also been very helpful in shaping my learning.  I tend to work by myself most of the time, but I think I am definitely expanding my horizons by working in pairs.

While we are just now entering the second unit of Phase 0, I feel like I have already learned so much just by learning how I learn!  Knowing your brain’s “settings”  is very powerful and can really help you learn new material more effectively and more efficiently.  So, in conclusion, learn you down thinking style! I think you’ll find that just being aware of this will help you in many facets of life, not just programming. Peace out!
