title: Stereotype Threat
---

Hello and welcome to another episode of cultural blogging with your host, <a href="https://johnlyden.github.io">John Lyden</a>.  Today we are going to talk about stereotype threat - what is it, how does it affect us and what can we do to reduce it.  <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">Steel & Aronson</a> define stereotype threat as being at risk of confirming, a self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group.  Before researching this topic, I never really thought about how it can really affect people.  I have personally never really felt too much of an impact from stereotype threat in the past.  I'm sure there are some stereotypes that I may fall into but I don't think they have ever really affected me in a way that has mattered.

I can definitely see how people may be very negatively affected by stereotype threat.  I am just always assuming people are going to judge me based on how I treat them and how I act, so I always try and treat every person how I would want to be interpreted. I think knowing that a negative stereotype exists about a group you belong to can mess with your confidence in regard to performance, but I think it goes deeper into how you see yourself.

I am just a dude who has some interests that may put me in a particular group that has certain stereotypes, but personally I never think about how people interpret me based on anything other that how I interact with them or present myself.  I never feel like I am affirming a belief or idea about anyone other than myself.  I am responsible for myself, and if I was in a situation that was causing me to feel uncomfortable because I'm part of a group then I would remove myself from that situation - I would not want to associate with an individual, group or organization that blindly makes assumptions about me based on a stereotype I may fall into.

One way to reduce stereotype threat is to be yourself and just say, "fuck stereotypes."  I know its not necessarily that easy, but as long as people exist, so will stereotypes.  The only solution I can offer for stereotype threat is to not think about it - be yourself, be decent and kind to everyone and establish yourself as yourself.
