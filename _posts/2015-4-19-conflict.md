title: Lets Talk About Conflict!
---

Hello and welcome to another episode of blogging culturally for Dev Bootcamp...I'm your host John Lyden.  Today, we are going to be discussing conflict!  Conflict is inevitable, but I think a lot of conflict is unneccessary and shouldn't even be an issue.  I think people get upset too easily and create problems out of nothing.

The example of conflict that I read in the overview of this assignment was pretty unnecessary.  A DBC student was upset because other students left dirty dishes in the sink everyday and she perceived that no one valued her time when she washed them.  It's not her job to clean up after everyone, so just stop cleaning and move on.This type of conflict doesn't move the needle at all...this kind of shit should not even register on your radar of importance.

One example of conflict in my life that comes to mind was a workplace conflict from about two years ago.  While working for a company in NC, I had to share a desk with one of my bosses because he thought it would be a good idea.  It was not pleasant due to the fact that it was cramped and it was my fuckin boss - who want's to share a desk with a boss looking over your shoulder at all times?  Since I was at work, and work generally sucks anyways, I just went on with business as usual.  After about six months of this, I was really over it.  The end of the year was coming up and rather than complaining to my boss and making an issue out of this, I continued to work hard and created a presentation on my work victories for the year and recommended that more space would be beneficial to my workflow and growth in the upcoming year.  Next thing you know, I have my own desk.

I was annoyed for the time I had to spend sharing a desk with my boss, but I think toughing it out and reporting on my good work for the year was a much better way to get my own space.  Actions speak louder than words - I didn't want to just lodge an empty complaint about this simply because "I don't like it."  I stopped and thought about what my bosses would respond to...I thought about how I could SHOW them that this alternative would be better.

If I could go back, I wouldn't do anything differently.  This experience just reinforced the notion that you must think about what people respond to.  Don't get emotional over things that really aren't that big of a deal.  Go with the flow and let your actions speak.  Goodnight everyone.
