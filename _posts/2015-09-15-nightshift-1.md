title: The Nightshift - Week 1
---

Last night I started this new, weekly meetup group/program called the [Nightshift](http://www.nightshiftc.lt/).  It's pretty cool because over the course of the next 10 weeks, we will be building an MVP for an actual client that solves a real world problem.  There are 35 people in this program - it's a mix of developers, designers and project managers and they've put us together in 7 groups, all of us coming up with our own unique approach to the problem we are assigned.

The first night was basically an introduction to the clients and a presentation of the problems they are looking to solve.  The first company to present was a new start-up out of Charlotte, NC called [Crown Town Compost](http://www.crowntowncompost.com/).  I really like the idea of this company and the environmental implications behind it.  Basically, restaurants and residential customers sign up for this program in order to divert their food waste from landfills to local composters in order to turn it into nutrient rich compost which is then delivered back to them.  So, how does it work?  Residential customers are given a bucket to collect their weekly food waste - it is then left out each week for collection with the garbage.  Crown Town then comes by and picks up the food waste by means of bicycle and returns to the customer a bucket of awesome compost material in which to plant crops and contribute to a more sustainable, less wasteful food economy

As you can imagine, picking up and hauling food waste by means of bicycle can be strenuous and difficult task, so they are looking for a technological means to find the most efficient routes between pickups and optimal routes in terms of going downhill when loads are heaviest.  In addition to route optimiztion, they are also looking to grow in other areas such as data collection, growth, marketing and communication via technology.  All in all, that seems like an awesome idea and a lot of opportunity to build something really cool.  In regards to food waste, this venture takes me back to a project I worked on a few months ago, [Full bellies](/portfolio/fullbellies).

The second presentation was done by the [United Way of Central Carolinas](http://www.uwcentralcarolinas.org/).  The presenter started off with a great point that is one of the underlying reasons behind this endeavor.  Everyone has heard of the United Way, but who actually knows what they do?  I sure don't, well I didn't...I do now.  Historically they are known for collecting large corporate donations and then dispearsing these donations amongst organizations they work with.  The United Way also helps connect people to volunteer with organzations in order to make a difference in areas they are passionate about.  While this is an awesome idea, it's easier said than done - volunteering isn't as easy as it should be and this project will help to change that.

Currently, it takes about 3 months for a citizen to sign up, connect with an organization and volunteer.  That's insane.  It's very difficult to find an organization that aligns with your interests and it takes forever.  There is a lot that can be done and many ways to approach this problem and I'm pretty stoked to be working on this project.

After meeting my team and talking about some assumptions and things we need to figure out in order to adequately tackle this problem, I feel really good.  We were already throwing around some great ideas, and when we meet up next week we will start to plan out our roadmap for helping connect volunteers with organzations and making it easier for everyone to make a difference in areas they are passionate about.
