Greetings...it has been a slow week on this damn blog - not as much time to talk because we are just about to get into the bulk of the work with putting together this app for the United Way.  Tonight we start the weekend long hackathon where all the groups will do most of their developing and I'm definitely ready to start chipping away at all these features.

This week we were able to get together our database and seed a lot fo the data we had been collecting by sifting through the PDFs of info that the United way has.  We have our associations and basic models done, but we now need to create all of our CRUD actions and routes for our models so that we can build out our React front end to talk to our backend rails API.

I'm saving my typing for tonight, so I will leave you with a [link to the hackathon](https://hack-the-night.herokuapp.com/) if you would like to attend - it will be full of coding, some educational talks and some beer(i'm bringing some fuggit).  One of the talks I am excited to hear is entitled, "Nobody Wants Junior Engineers"...how very encouraging.
