title: CSS Hover Effects
---

So I've been trying to find some new resources to work on sprucing up my frontend CSS skillz and one excellent resource I have started utilizing is Tumblr.  Originally I joined Tumblr to look up [dank memes](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/875/511/a69.png), but it turns out its a great place to learn some new stuff about programming.

One of my favorite tumblrs I have found so far has been [CSS Buttons](http://cssbuttons.tumblr.com/)...this is where I found a great tutorial on making these really cool hover effects for buttons.  I would like to make some sort of dope effect each day, so I might just do that.  For now, check out these [dope hover effects](http://john-lyden.com/hover-styles/index.html).  Peep the code [here](https://github.com/johnlyden/hover-styles).
