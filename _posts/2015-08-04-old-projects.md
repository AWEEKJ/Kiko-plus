title: Getting Back to Old Projects!
---

Coming back to North Carolina and being on the hunt for a new job while simultaneously trying to convince your old job for that raise you've been waiting for over the last 3 years really leaves you with some time.  With that time I have been coming back to old projects I used to work on a lot more - projects that used to bring in some nice coin at the end of each month.  One such project is [marijuanasocks.com](www.marijauanasocks.com).

I know you're probably thinking "LOL" right about now, but this site has been farily successfull in the past.  It was built with [Wordpress](www.wordpress.org) about 2 years ago when the only development tools I really knew were wordpress and random plugins and scripts I could find online.  This website is more of an SEO and eCommerce play than a web development project that I would want to include on my technical resume.

i built this site because I used to work in a skateshop and I started seeing all these random dudes, kids and kids' moms coming into the store just to buy these socks with marijuana leaves printed all over them.  People wanted this shit and it still wasn't tooooo popular so I figured I would make a dumbass website about it and try to gain rankings for relatable search terms.  In order to monetize the site, I originally used a script called [phpBay](www.phpbay.com) which allowed me to pull in matching eBay auctions to my site so that I could display them for sale as if my site was a "store".  Customers would then click through and I would receive a commission if their clicks resulted in purchases - I have done this with other niche products in the past, some which are too embarassing to talk about right now.

Eventually the site got pretty popular and I was able to purchase my own socks, integrate a Shopify store with my blog and sell these things all over the world.  It was great side money, especially while living in New York - but eventually school and other jobs took over so I had to scale back to being an eBay affiliate again...but not before my site was featured on [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shopify/7-strangest-stores-in-sho_b_5064620.html).

So, while I'm back in NC and searching for a new developer gig, I'm going to be coming back to old projects and improving them with the new skills I've developed over the last year,
