title: Final Project at DBC!
---

Well it has now been a little over two weeks since I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in NYC and while it has been nice to have a little downtime and not work 12 hour days, every single day, I do miss parts of it.  As crazy as it sounds, I miss the most hectic time of the whole experience, the final week. The final week was dedicated to ideating and creating a final project from scratch.  Many ideas were pitched but in the end only four ideas were created, and I was fortunate enough to work on a really cool project with a couple of really cool dudes.

 The final project I worked on was [FullBellies](/portfolio/fullbellies).  You can read more about this project in this [article](http://blog.devbootcamp.com/2015/full-bellies-feeding-people-reducing-food-waste/) or in my [portfolio](/portfolio), but its essentially an application that was built with the intention of cutting down on overall food waste, while also making affordable meals more accessaible.  It was a very long week of learning, building and overcoming technical brick walls that stood in our way - check out our punchcard during the build process

Our wise and sagacious teacher, [Steven Harms](http://stevengharms.com/), informed us that this probably wasn't the best route to take and that we would probably be burnt out in the next two weeks if we kept on a schedule like that (and eventually ruin our lives if we tried to keep that up in our careers), but for the sake of a one week build time, I think we were all willing to put in the extra hours.

Anyways, peep game the [live site](http://fullbellies.herokuapp.com) if you want to play around with it and start putting a dent into the 131 billion pounds of food that gets wasted every year.
