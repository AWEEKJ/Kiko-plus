### still working

Well, its the week before the final week of Nighshift and that means that all of our time is spent chugging along, building out the required features for our MVP.  The progress and pivots we have made thus far have been really cool and very insightful in terms of delivering a final product to an actual client. I feel like our group has come  a long way and we are going to have something really dope for our final presentation next Friday.

### Food
So this post goes out to all 1 of my glutten intollerant friends out there.  We had some delicious pizza last night, but I had some issues with some of the react dependencies and had to work with Jonathan for awhile to get that sorted out.  Once that was straightened out, I went over to grab a slice and all that was left was a little box with what I thought was thin crust cheese, but it turns out it was some glutten free pizza...WHO KNEW?  I think I'll continue to eat the glutten-full pizza in the future, but the glutten free ain't bad.  Once I was full and free of glutten it was time to git 2 werk.

### Werk
Our team is in a really good spot.  We have a lot of the functionalities we need working, its just a matter of connecting them together at this point.  As a team, we went through the flow of our application and made final notes on things we need to get worked out by next week.  It was very helpful to do this becuase we picked up on different areas that needed adjustments.

Once we were all on the same page with what needed to be done and what our plan of attack was, it was time to GIT 2 WERK.  One big thing we got done last night was deploying our existing application to Heorku so we could ensure that everything compiled and deployed correctly - and it did so that's a big relief.  I'm not going to show you the live version of the app just yet becuase it still needs a lot of work, but u shall see it soon, don't worry.

So yeah, this week we have to tye up the loose ends on our project and get a rough draft of our presentation ready for dry runs on Monday.  We are going to practice our presentation in front of the Nightshifters on Monday so that we will be ready for the real deal on Friday, November 20th.  Our presentations should be super fun and it will be a really cool feeling to finally complete this awesome project that we have all been working so hard on in our spare time throughout the last two and a half months!
