title: Happy Friday!
---

Today marks another glorious Friday where the sun is shining and the work Gods are blessing your boy with 2 consecutive days of chill.  The chill is real, but I will stll be working on my own [projects](/portfolio) over the weekend and continuing to brush up on my interviewing skillz.

I think I might make another joke application this weekend or a complaint app...I'm thinking of an application where you enter in your complaint and then you see it get flushed down a toilet.  Enjoy your Friday and enjoy this song.
