title: The Nightshift - Week 4
---

##Prototyping

Another Tuesday morning means another Nightshift down.  As we go in into working through week 4 of this project, we are really starting to get into the nitty gritty and hammering out previews of our products that our client can actually interact with and give feedback on...but feedback is for next week.  This week we went deeper into the tools that can  help us get these full and touchable prototypes ready...but before the tools, ya boi needs some fuel, so lets talk about da fuuuuud.

###Fuuud

It was a chill, rainy ass Monday and nothing lifts my spirits from the depressing puddle that is a rainy workday coming out of a rainy weekend more than pizza...this time an added bonus, CHEERWINE.

During pizza and drank, we went over some of the sketches our designer came up with over the last week and got a more visual flow of how our application will work.  We also went through a lot of the JSON data that we have started to compile in order to build out our database of involvment opportunities that the United Way provides.  We also talked more in depth about the nature and format of our quiz which will eventually help direct prospective volunteers to the appropriate opportunity.  All in all, we seem to be on a good path at this point in time.  Now time 4 a talk!

This week's talk was given by resident Skookum UX Designer & Front End Developer [Rob Luke](https://twitter.com/roblukedesign).  As you can probably tell from the h2 tag at the top of this post, it was all about prototyping.  Before we dove into the tools and techniques for creating an awesome prototype, Rob addressed a sentiment that I have had ever since I started learning to code, which is that learning something new is fucking scary.  There are so many languages, frameworks, tools and bullshit out there that it can seem extremely overwhelming to even know where to begin.

While these new ideas and processes are defiitely scary, they are also super exciting...so, go ahead and dive in and learn as much as you can.  Adding to this idea of new tools and learning whatever new derp.js framework has just come out, one thing Rob mentioned that I have heard many other senior devs say is to just know and understand the basics.  Tools and flashy plugins will always come and go, a new JS framework or grid system will pop up everday, but HTML and Javascript will always be relevant...so understand that shit and the tools will make sense with time.

So, prototyping...it's super important.  Continuing with what we talked about [last week]({% post_url 2015-09-29-nightshift-week-3 %}), bringing a client something they can actually touch and play with is so so so so sooooo helpful in getting honest feedback and making sure that you are on the right path to shipping a quality product.  Having an interactive prototype that spans across all mediums, allowing the client to scroll and click buttons helps to reaffirm the following assumptions:

+ What Am I designing?
+ Why am I designing?
+ Who am I designing for?
+ What is their background?
+ What is the focus?

We walked through a real world example of prototyping from an actual project at Skookum, in which Rob took a very basic layout of a basic employee profile and made it super sick through a few iterations, some handy tools and a good eye!

We went more indo depth with working in Sketch.  Honestly, that is something I need to look more into.  Over the last 2 years I have been focusing on the backend - I tend to not think so much about front end design and making things look awesome, but getting a better handle on that will only make me stronger.

Rob showed us a bunch of helpful plugins that go with sketch and stressed the point of designing in terms of percentages instead of pixels, which helps immensely with responsive design.  The [Sketch Flex layout](https://github.com/hrescak/Sketch-Flex-Layout) is a plugin for sketch that allows you to use CSS Flexbox layouts using stylesheets...so instead of adjusting every element for every change, the sketch itself becomes sorta responsive.  We also covered some other tools that make design and development much easier, [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) to name a few.

One of the main things I took away from this week was the importance of designing in the browser. It's an excellent way to prototype, not only because the browser is the final resting place for your digital product, but because its easy to change!  Think about it...sending out screenshots, .PDFs or files, once those things are sent to the client, THEY GONE.  If you see a mistake after you hit 'send', welp...too late!  But, if your prototype exists in the browser on a private url or gh-pages repo, simply change that shit the next minute!  I really like that idea because its super practical in so many ways.

Great Week, lots of work ahead for client meetings next week.  Enjoy some Morrissey.
