Dear Diary, its me John.  I'm writing to you today from my porch as I reflect on a wonderful day that was had by myself and a few friends.  Instead of staying in Charlotte this weekend, we took a trip to the Waynesville and Asheville, North Carolina for some skating, eating and drinking.

We started the day off by leaving 1 hour later than we had planned due to the time being too early and my bed being too comfortable.  We hit the road around 8:30 and started skating by 11 at our first stop, the Waynesville Skatepark.   See shitty quality video below for a quick back to back action from myself and my buddy Nick

After we skated there for awhile and I fell a few times, we headed to Asheville to skate the DIY foundation spot which is pretty tight - its basically a free public skatepark built by cool dudes in Asheville. Everyone there was super nice and welcoming, I really like that place.  We also ate some really good burritos from this place called Bandidos - you should check dat place out, I'm serious.  After eating and having a few brews we headed back to Charlotte where I then proceeded to eat more food on a lil dub date with my friends and my bb.  This time it was Vietnamese.  Then I had a few more beers with some friends.  Then I came home.  Then I went to bed.  Then I woke up and here I am LIVE FROM THE PORCH.
