Good Evening and welcome to Christmas Eve.  This is my first post in quite a while...mostly becuase I started a new full time job doing front end development for Bank of America.  It's been pretty tight so far, it's just harder to work on my own projects when I get home from da DAILY GRIND!

Today is wrapping up my first two weeks with the company and I know I'm going to learn a lot...one thing I'm pretty excited about is using nodeJS.  I've worked through a few different frameworks, but I think this is going be be a real winner.  Utilizing Javasript for both front and backend code is dope.  I am going to try and work on stuff at home, and build some solo projects...it's just hard to find the time now.

We use Subversion as our version control at the bank, so let me see if I can still commit and push this shit up with git.  Looking at my commit history hurts now...its been a few weeks.  I wanna get those green squares filled up again damnit.
