title: Breakout in Javascript!
---

When I first started to really dive deep into Javascript, I hated it.  I was coming from Ruby Land where everything had its place and it seemed so much more structured - I thought Javascript was just all over the place, unorganized and I found myself getting pissed at it on the regs.  Well, fast forward to life after DBC when its not "GO, GO, GO" every second and I find myself really liking it...so much that I'm going to be doing a few different projects in pure Javascript.

The first of these projects I shall present to you is a 'Breakout' style game.  I always wanted to build something like this simply because I love playing the game.  When I was going to DBC and living in Brooklyn, I would always save my quarters so I could skate to Barcade and spend them all on Arkanoid...ocassionally I would play Tetris, but I really meant business with Arkanoid.

My version of the game is not as complicated but it serves its purpose.  Click on the image below or checkout the [source code](https://github.com/johnlyden/Breakout) on [my github](https://github.com/johnlyden/).  Use the arrow keys or the mouse to control the paddle.
