description: I'm at Central Coffee and OMG you won't guess what just happened...

Nothing actually happened - I just clickbaited your ass into viewing this post.  The real news is what's happening tomorrow...I'm getting married OK?!?

I'm just chilling at the coffee shop now trying to re-do my portfolio and get it all setup for my next step in life...which is not working at the fucking bank.  Real talk...not a fan of working for the bank, but I'm a dedicated developer so I will not leave my people in the dust until my contract has expired.

Its sunday, perhaps the best day of the week.
