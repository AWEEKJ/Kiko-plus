title: First Day in NC - Learning Ember!
---

Today has been my first full day back in North Carolina and here is what I did...I went to daggum work.  Luckily for me I only had to be in the office for a half day.  I went in there to talk about what I'm doing next and I think it'll be good.  Tomorrow imma go peep some apartments with my girl n our dawg.

Today I also started a [really good ember tutorial](http://www.thetechcofounder.com/getting-started-with-ember-js-using-ember-cli/).  I think this is the same tutorial from the [ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) but its explained well so far.  Ember was something that I didn't really do well with during my time at DBC(i mean we only spent like 1 day on it neways) but it's a front end framework I really wanna learn and something that will be appropriate for a project I want to work on.

thats it for now.  peace out.
