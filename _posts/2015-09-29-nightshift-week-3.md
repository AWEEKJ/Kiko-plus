##Design

Its Tuesday and that means that yesterday was Monday...and that means that the weekly, hands-on, product development meetup known as [Nightshift CLT](http://nightshiftc.lt) took place.  Last night was a good one - We started the design process, learned some helpful tools and hammered out a basic wireframe of our MVP.  But first, the food...

###The Food

So last night I eagerly walk through the doors of [Skookum](http://skookum.com), ready to assemble with my team and get down to working out the user flow and basic design of our app...but, upon entering, I'm immediately distracted by the sweet smell of tacos.  That's right, there was a nice platter of all the ingredients for tacos, burritos, chips and queso from Salsarita's...gracias Nightshift, it was V delicious.  Knock back a few MT DEW/SPRITE combos and its time to start.

###Design and Concept Generation

For the first half of Nightshift, one of the mentors ususally gives a very informative and helpful talk that introduces concepts, ideas and tools that will greatly assist each of the teams throughout the whole process...tonight was no different.  Stephen, one of the Design mentors, gave a talk about concept generation...going from the "What?" to the "How?"

The design is important because it allows us to communicate visually instead of just conceptually.  We started the talk by closing our eyes and envisioning a car as Stephen verbally described it...while I was able to conceptualize something that resembled a car in my mind, it didn't really match the visusal that was on the screen when I opened my eyes...and accurately describing and presenting an idea, or an iteration of an idea, to a client is of paramount importance to the agile process.

Bringing visual representations, or sketches, of a product to the client early and often helps affirm early validations which will guide us in knowing that we are on the right path with this product.  Having something to show, rather than just words to describe will make a huge difference in keeping to the expectations of the client.  Giving the client something they can touch and interact with will allow them to give more honest and valuable feedback.

Feedback is so very important...with product design and with life in general.  Feedback allows you go receive a unique perspective in how other people view or interact with a product and the world.  Not only will feedback aid you with design, but it will aid you in learning a new skill, interacting with people, writing a song, etc.  Feedback is a good thing.  And [Feedback was a great skate video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbbHFrX6EfI).

Feedback is just part of iterative development...its a big ol' loop consisting of ideas, sketching, mixing and matching ideas, analyzing the big picture, adding features, trashing features, and getting feedback.

Following this talk we had a quick run through/tutorial on [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) which is an awesome tool that lets you take a basic wireframe and create a visusal representation of what you want the final product to look like.  Its a mix of some of the best features of Photoshop and Illustrator with some added bonuses that make it really great for developers as well.  For example, one great tip we learned from a developer's standpoint, is that you can export icons directly from Sketch to an SVG file...so you don't have to wait for a designer to make those files and send them over.  Also, through Sketch, you can copy the CSS attributes directly from the program.  If your designer used a sick gradient or drop shadow, you can grab the CSS code to make that element look perfect JUS LIKE DAT!

Following the talk, our group assembled and came up with a pretty good wireframe and flow of our web application.  Our project seems to be so open ended that it was really hard to hammer down our features that are actually achievable in the tight timeframe we have, but once we did, we came up with a very simple, intuitive flow that seems to solve the problem of connecting volunteers to organizations V efficiently.

We have a good split of responsibilities this week, so coming into Week 4 we should have a sick Sketch of our product and be a little bit closer in terms of figuring out how to start building out these features.
