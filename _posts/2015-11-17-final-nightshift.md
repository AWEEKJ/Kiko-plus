title: The Final Nightshift
---

Greetings everyone, today marks a historic day in Nightshift 2.0's history, it is the day after the final Nightshift meeting...now, now, don't be sad because there is still final presentations coming up this friday, and you can actually come out and peep the presentations yourself...just [RSVP Here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nightshift-launch-tickets-19550824041).

This last meeting was all about running through our final presentations, working out all the kinks in our demo and getting our presenation time to just around 10 minutes.  I was/am very excited for final presentaitons; it feels really good to finsih a project and show something to your peers that you are actually really proud of.  Everyone on Team Apollo worked really hard so its a great feeling to see it all come together and how we actually built a solution to an actual problem we were tasked with figuring out.

All of the groups did a really great job presenting and all of the projects look amazing!  I was very impressed with everything I saw and I can't wait for the final final presentaitons on Friday.

Oh yes, we had some pizza for f00dz this week and my glutten free ppl will be happy to know that there was glutten free pizza once again.  Anyways, we are still making a few final tweaks to our United Way application, so I won't post the live link just yet, but I will throw it up on Friday, so stay tuned.  Until then, enjoy this picture of us presenting:
