title: What is Up!
---

Greetings, welcome to a new blog post...the first in over two months.  Dev Bootcamp has been really cool so far and way more challenging than I ever thought it would be!  Lots of things have changed in the last two months - I am now going back to North Carolina at the end of August so I am excited/nervous to see what opportunities I can seek out back in the old tarheel state.

New York is cool, but I'm happy to be going home.  I have some prospects on what I want to do when I get back, but I'm just hoping that I can start building something of a normalish life in the coming months.  Stoked to get back to my dog and my Colombian Princess.  Peace out.
