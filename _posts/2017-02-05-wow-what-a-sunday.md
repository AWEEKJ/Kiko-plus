woof woof haaaaa 'i just wanna chiiiiilll' (see youtube henny video)

It's been wild for me as a dog since donald dump took over PHEW! someone save us! ðŸ˜®
today is super bowl sunday - nothing too special tho its just the patriots again but maybe the falcons will win but that's not whats imporant here - 
the reason i mention that dumbass game is because LADY GAGA has the opportunity to make the whole event into a circus and most of us 
really hope she does! jajajajajajajaj i cannot wait. if she doesnt then you best believe they quiet her ass down cos we all know how 
wild she is and where she stands. 

woof woof
anyways 
my parents are engaged and im 56 years old (doggo years so dont think im an ole coot) so im going to be chillin with them in 
their brand new path to success. 
2016 was a good year for us and we all know how shitty we thought that was but if we survived that
i know we can survive anything. 
i heard them talking about moving back to new york - gotta see if i can weasel my ass up there AGAIN lol
anyways gonna go sunbathe out on the porch see u later
