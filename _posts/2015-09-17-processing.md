Ay yo, I just wanted to test out this processing plugin that will let me post .pde sketches.  I used to make some funny, interactive pictures with Processing but couldn't get the .pde sketches to show up on my page (this was years ago OK I CAN DO IT NOW).  So, get used to it because I'm going to start making some new ones and post them here.  Enjoy this little one that just makes a cool repeating circle LOL.
