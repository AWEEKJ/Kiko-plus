title: Asking Questions!
---

Welcome to the final blog post of Phase 0 at [Dev Bootcamp](https://www.devbootcamp.com)!  This week I am going to be brief because I have been reviewing my ass off this weekend and I have to be at school in the morning...and das some shit ya boi hasn't done in like 8 years.

Asking questions is super important in the learning process.  I have seen some excellent questions posted on Stack Overflow and on the Google+ community.  I think the key to asking a good question is being specific and brief.  Asking a super long and complicated question is hard to follow.  The best pracitice would be to break down your question into small parts and, rather than asking a broad question, ask something specific that will help you put the pieces together and come to a conclusion yourself...I think that is the best way to actually understand.

Das all I got tonight, peep u all in da AM!
