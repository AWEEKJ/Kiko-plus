title: Off the Computer and In da River!
---

ay yo, dis ain't your normal blog post about regular expressions or programming bullshit, today i'm speaking some real truth about getting out of the house and going swimming in a river.  It's good to get out of the house and remember that there is some nature out there that is way more fun than the damn internet.  Here is a photo of my bb enjoying this beautiful river in the mountains of NC.
