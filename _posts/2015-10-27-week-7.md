##Fireside Chats

![fireside-chat](/images/fireside.png)

Greetings.  This post is going to be short and sweet because A) I am re-doing the company website at work and that deadline is approaching, B) The deadline for our Nightshift project is also rapidly approaching, and C) I had to leave Nightshift early last night to pick up bae from the airport.  Long story short, there is a lot of work to do.

While I was only able to be around for the firt half of Nightshift last night, I did get to enjoy some delicious pizza (flatcrust of course) and take part in the very helpful fireside chat.  Everyone divided into groups based on their roles in the project - so all the developers met with each other, designers with designers and PM's with other PM's.  This gave us all time to talk about common issues, problems, strategies and solutions.

Meeting with the developers was cool because I feel like everyone has some of the same concerns and stresses about learning new technologies and a rapidly approaching deadline - It was comforting to see that we are all in the same boat!  Also, meeting like this let everyone know that we are there to help each other and it was a good transition into some interteam collaboration.

In our chats, we shared strategies and things that have been working well - one idea that I really took away from this expereience is to set up more milestones and measurable goals within our team.  Everyone has their tasks and what they're responsible for in the project, but we definitely need to implement more milestones on this build.  Other than that, we got some good feedback on routes to take and tools to use going into the next few weeks of development.

One thing that I am really thankful for throughout this whole project, is that we were forced to use a brand new technology (React).  Check out my post from the hackathon where we heard a great talk about becoming an [expert in new]({% post_url 2015-10-20-hack-the-night %}).This could have been just another Rails project, which would have still been cool, but in our quests for that sick developer job, we need to be focusing on the new and React is going to be an excellent tool to have on my batbelt coming out of this experience.
