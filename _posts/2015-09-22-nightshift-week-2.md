title: The Nightshift - Week 2

##Ideation & Questions

Good Afternoon.  After another late night pullin down week 2 of da [NIGHTSHIFT](http://www.nightshiftc.lt/), I figured I'd catch you up to speed with the program and our project.  For starters, I got in around 6 and enjoyed some dank sandwiches.  After 20-30 minutes of catching up and drinking Mountain Dew we started off with a few really good and informative talks given by some of the mentors at [Skookum](http://skookum.com/).

The first talk was all about client requirements and relating these requirements to the Agile Methodology of product development.  Nightshift mentor and resident musician, Jason Rome, led this talk and communicated the ideas of Agile by walking us through multiple iterations in the process of writing a Nightshift Theme song.  With every iteration of the song, Jason would ask for feedback through asking appropriate questions - some being open ended, some being close ended.  As developers, designers and creators, we want to understand the intent of the product, not the client's expression of intent.  We do this by asking exploratory questions and looking at who the product is actually for.  Who are the users?  Are there similar ideas out there?  What information can I find about the actual intent of this idea?  All of these discoveries will help make better changes and ultimately lead to a better product much faster.

Following this exercise was a brief talk about one of the main tools we will be using for managing the lifecycle of this project - [Trello](https://trello.com/).  I've used Trello a few times in the past and know how great it can be with keeping everything organized and delegating tasks amongst a team.  I learned a few nifty tricks during this talk; for example, if you're on a card and hit space, that is a super easy way to assign that card to yourself.  Shortcuts r the best.

For the final hour of Nighshft, we broke off into teams and talked about our assumptions we had made the week before regarding our application for the United Way.  We made assumptions about what our application needs, how users would interact with it, and what features would be neccessary in order to solve the problem at hand.  We found that making the process of signing up quick and *immediately* getting matched up with multiple appropriate organizations are the basic and most important functionalities of our application.

Getting slightly ahead of ourselves, we started walking through the flow of our application and how we envisioned this process working out.  This helped us sort of figure out what the main features of our applicaiton will be.  From here we need to finalize the core features of our web application so that we can begin the design stage next week.  Another great week in da books, talk 2 u later.
