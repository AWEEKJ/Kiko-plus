## Getting started with Docker

**TL;DR**: _I describe how to get started with Docker & Docker Compose, using it to set up a workflow for Python applications._

## What is Docker?

Let me just quote the official website:

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

It's like a VM, but light-weight and more focussed. Docker container typically wrap just a single application. This allows Docker & tools like Docker Compose to combine these containers in useful ways as we'll see later on.

## Installation (osx)

I've tried to use Docker in the past, and I was always less than impressed by the process. It involved virtual machines, boot2docker, custom shells and what not.

Luckily the process has been simplified significantly, just download and install the Docker app from https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac.
