title: Hack the Night
---

Well, the weekend is over and so is my first hackathon, [Hack the Night](https://hack-the-night.herokuapp.com/).  It was a long, but fun weekend full of coding, beer and pizza...oh and cookies, doritos and sandwiches...oh and some wild cherry pepsi too, but mostly coding.  Major props to Steven and Jonathan from Skookum for putting this whole thing together and being there all weekend to help everyone out with their projects...really cool of you dudes!

The hackathon was a time mostly to get the foundation laid out for our application and get our environments setup.  In addition to some hard work, we were also treated to some really awesome talks.  One talk that I alluded to in my [last post]({% post_url 2015-10-16-prepare-hackathon %}) was called "Nobody Wants Junior Engineers" and that was one of my favorite talks I've heard.  This talk was given by this really nice guy from Heroku named [Hunter Loftis](https://twitter.com/hunterloftis) - not only did he give a great talk full of great advice for everyone aspiring to someday be successful developers, but he was there all weekend long helping everyone with their projects which was really cool.

So this talk was all about why companies seem to not want junior level developers...which is something I feel strongly about because that is kinda what I am trying to do.  It can feel very intimidating because there is just so much shit out there to learn, and its hard to feel comfortable when it seems like there are so many people who have been learning this shit for way longer than you...this talk helped to ease some of those concerns and offer some really sound advice on how to actually get into these positions.

###Become an expert in "new"

So in my programming education thus far, a majority of my learning has been with Ruby on Rails and Javascript, with HTML and CSS...stuff that has been around for a hot minute.  Even though plenty of people are still hiring Rails developers, this technology has been out for a while and there are a lot of people who have become 'Experts' in this technology.  So it makes sense that this would be a fairly competitive job market to enter as a junior when companies can just as easily find more seasoned developers in that technology.  The advice Hunter had for us in regards to this, is to become an expert in new - look towards new technologies that aren't as flooded with experts and become an expert in that!

I really like this idea because I really enjoy learning new technologies and want to differentiate myself as a developer.  While I like to learn new technologies, I am reminded of another nugget of gold I mined from this talk:

>Embrace good enough - be selective, don't be an expert in everything

If we spend all of our time learning every new technology and framework that comes out, we will never really learn anything...and thats so true.  We need to pick something to specialize in, something that we can learn really well and become experts in, but its hard to actually narrow that down to a stack thats fun, but also emerging.

Throughout this project, the Nightshift guys have been pushing us to build our frontend in either React or Node...and these are two technologies that are becoming very popular but are still fairly new.  I think at this point in my dev career, after trying out a few different js frameworks, I am going to focus on really learning React.  I like the idea of components in React, but I also love that with React Native you can develop across all platforms...it just seems super efficient and a tool that I want to have in my stack.

In addition to these pointers, Hunter also gave a few predictions about technologies that he thinks will be taking off in the next few years and things that would be dope to start learning now.  One technology he mentioned that I have been super interested in is Virtual Reality.  We had an [Oculus Rift](https://developer.oculus.com/) at DBC which was super cool and seems like it would be super fun to write programs for that platform.

So yeah, this was a very encouraging talk that answered a lot of questions and concerns that I have had in the last year.  There were many other great talks given throughout the weekend, but I shall save those recaps for another day...I gotta get back to this project!  We still have a lot of work left on our application, but I think everyone put in a lot of hard work this weekend and we got a lot done!
