**TL;DR**: _I describe how to get started with Docker & Docker Compose, using it to set up a workflow for Python applications._

## What is Docker?

Let me just quote the official website:

> Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.

It's like a VM, but light-weight and more focussed. Docker container typically wrap just a single application. This allows Docker & tools like Docker Compose to combine these containers in useful ways as we'll see later on.

### Installation (osx)

I've tried to use Docker on osx in the past, and I was always less than impressed by the process. It involved virtual machines, boot2docker, custom shells and what not.

Luckily the process has been simplified significantly, just download and install the Docker app from the [Docker download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac "download Docker").

### Terminology

Before we proceed, let's go through some of the terminology.

|||
|-|-|
|**Dockerfile**|A textfile containing the instructions to build your Docker image|
|**Image**|The result of runnng your `Dockerfile`, ready to be instantiated and shared|
|**Container**|An instance of an image, ready to run|
|**Repository**|Where images are stored so they can be easily deployed and shared|

## An Example Python application: Generating a Fibonacci Sequence

We'll write an Python script that accepts a `--length` commandline argument and print out the specified number of items of the Fibonacci sequence.

```python
# example1.py
from itertools import islice

import click


def fibonacci_sequence():
    i, j = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield i
        i, j = j, i + j


@click.command()
@click.option('--length', default=5, help='Length of the Fibonacci sequence.')
def example1(length):
    """Simple program that prints out LENGTH items of the Fibonacci sequence."""
    for i in islice(fibonacci_sequence(), length):
        click.echo('-> {}'.format(i))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    example1()
```

To parse the commandline arguments, we use a library called Click. To use it we'll add it to `requirements.txt`.

```
# requirements.txt
click==6.7
```

### Dockerfile

Now we need to create a `Dockerfile`. This file will describe what our image will contain and how our app wil be run.

An important first step is choosing a base image. It's gonna contain the OS and programs we're gonna start out with. It's the first line in your `Dockerfile`, using the `FROM` keyword, followed by the name of the image and the `tag` or version.

The official Docker base images have a single-word name, like `ubuntu` or `alpine`.

For example we could choose to use the Ubuntu image. This way we can use the `apt` package manager to install the neccesary software, like Python.

```
FROM ubuntu:16:04

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y -q python-all python-pip 
```

There are valid reasons for using this approach, but it means that the image will contain the full Ubuntu OS and everything that comes with it, resulting in a 180MB image. The philosophy of Docker is to have focussed, application specific containers, so you probably won't need everything that Ubuntu will install for you.

For this reason many different kinds base images have emerged, some very minimal like Busybox or Alpine.

![Docker image sizes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Docker_Image_Size.png)

Even better yet, there are specialised images that come preinstalled with a specific Python version! Let's use the Alpine Python 3.6 image for this application and finish the `Dockerfile`.

```
# example1/Dockerfile
FROM python:3.6-alpine

# Install python dependencies
ADD ./requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt

# Copy the source code to /opt/example1
ADD . /opt/example1/

# Run!
WORKDIR /opt/example1
CMD ["python", "example1.py"]
```

Let's go through these lines, one-by-one:

`FROM python:3.6-alpine` tells Docker to base this image on the Alpine base image that comes with python 3.6 installed.

`ADD ./requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt` copies the requirements file from the host to the container's `/tmp` directory and `RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt` executes it with `pip` within the container.

`ADD . /opt/example1/` copies the full contents of the host's directory to `/opt/example1/`.

You might be wondering why the `requirements.txt` was copied & installed in a separate step instead of executing it from `/opt/example1/requirements.txt` after copying the full directory.

The reason for this is that Docker images are versioned and will only be rebuild when changes have been detected. So `ADD ./requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt` will only be re-executed when `requirements.txt` has changed, while the `ADD . /opt/example1/` will be re-executed every time something any file changed.

At last we change the current working directory and run the Python script with `CMD ["python", "example1.py"]` using the default Python interpreter, which is Python 3.6 in this image.

### Build

Now it's time to build our first image! Open a terminal and change to the directory that contains the `Dockerfile`, run `docker build --tag kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1 .`.

Docker will now pull the base image and apply the steps we defined in our `Dockerfile`.

![Docker build]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vdZURJyid1.gif)

We've build an image called `kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1` based on the `Dockerfile` found in current directory (note the `.` in the end).

A `docker images` will show us the images now available on our system. Note that our base image is also in there.

```
~ docker images
REPOSITORY                                    TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1   latest              f6c114182e15        5 minutes ago       93.28 MB
python                                        3.6-alpine          b30df2468c80        10 days ago         88.6 MB
```

### Run

This is the moment you have been waiting for, we're going to create a container and run it using the `docker run kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1` command, which should display the first 5 items of the Fibonacci sequence.

```
~ docker run kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1
-> 0
-> 1
-> 1
-> 2
-> 3
```

Docker has created a container from our image and ran it. We can ask Docker to list our containers using `docker ps --all`. We need to add the `--all` flag because by default we'll only see running containers and our application exits after displaying the Fibonacci sequence. 

Note that every consecutive run will create a new container and assign a random name to it:

```
~ docker ps --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                         COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
02092c5ee1b0        kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1   "python example1.py"   3 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                       compassionate_nobel
c880e7bf233d        kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1   "python example1.py"   3 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                       evil_heisenberg
```

We can clean up these container by noting the `CONTAINER ID` and running `docker rm <CONTAINER ID>`. Running the container with the `--rm` flag will automatically remove the container after it exits.

When we execute the run command, Docker will execute the `CMD ["python", "example1.py"]` we've defined in our `Dockerfile`, but we can override this by passing the command from the commandline directly:

```
~ docker run kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1 python example1.py --length 10
-> 0
-> 1
-> 1
-> 2
-> 3
-> 5
-> 8
-> 13
-> 21
-> 34
```

Making changes to the source code will not autmatically propagate those to the existing image and containers. You will first have to rebuild it. Depending on the nature of the changes you will notice the rebuild is a lot faster, since it only executes the steps that have been affected by the change.

```
docker build --tag kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1 .

```

### Interactive shell

Since we can execute arbitrary command within our container, we can also launch a shell! To do this we need to tell Docker that we want an interactive shell by providing the flags `--interactive --tty` and executing the `/bin/sh` command in the container.

```
~ docker run --interactive --tty kenophob.io/getting-started-docker-example1 /bin/sh
/opt/example1 # ls
Dockerfile        example1.py       requirements.txt
/opt/example1 #
```

This is useful for debugging and inspecting the runtime environment of the container.
