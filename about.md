My name is John - I like to [write code](https://github.com/johnlyden) and build cool things.

I have been making websites since I went to business school and realized that you pretty much have to have a website in order to have a business.

I am familiar with modern programming languages/frameworks/technologies including but not limited to Javascript, Java, Ruby, PHP, React, Rails, Ember, Backbone, Jekyll, JQuery, HTML, CSS and any other framework that might be popular at this point.  I am extremely comfortable with Git & SVN  workflow, Test Driven Development, MVC architecture, RESTful design and Agile development methodologies.

In addition to coding, you can catch me [skateboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S_lDP1NsQI), hanging with my dog, and [other things](/other) that don't involve staring at a computer all day.
